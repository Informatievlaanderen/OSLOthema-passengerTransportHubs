OSLO Passenger Transport Hubs is a trajectory initiated by GreenMov and Digitaal Vlaanderen. GreenMov is a CEF (Connecting Europe Facility) project within the framework of the Green Deal to bring smart mobility data together and make it accessible with the ultimate aim of realising greener mobility. GreenMov and Digital Flanders contribute to harmonising mobility datasets, creating integrated services (cross-services) and new cross-border functionalities by combining various datasets. 

A passenger transport hub is a place with a diverse range of transport options. Depending on the location, you will find trains, tram and bus stops, shared vehicles, a Park & Ride, bicycle parking spaces, etc. These modes of transport are coordinated with each other and are preferably supplemented with additional services. Such a transport hub is also optimally organised spatially. The aim is to facilitate multimodality: access to and transfer between the various transport options. In Flanders, Belgium passenger transport hubs are being branded as 'Hoppin Points'. A semantic data model of Hoppin Points, <a href="https://data.vlaanderen.be/standaarden/kandidaat-standaard/vocabularia-en-applicatieprofielen-hoppinpunten.html">OSLO Hoppinpunten</a>, is created in Dutch and used as basis for this trajectory.
